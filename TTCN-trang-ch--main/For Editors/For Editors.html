            You will follow as submission throughout the workflow, from first submission to final publication.
          </p>
          <p>The workflow is divided into 4 stages:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Submission:</strong> This is where new submissions land while being assigned to Section Editors and considered for moving into the Review stage. Some submissions are clearly inappropriate and never make it beyond this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Review:</strong> This is where the peer review happens, as well as any revisions required by the author. Some submission will not pass review and end here. Those that are accepted move to the next stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Copyediting:</strong> Accepted articles move to this stage, where they are improved by the work of a copyeditor. Authors can be given the opportunity to review the copyedits.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Production:</strong> Once the copyedits are completed and approved, the submission moves to this stage. In Production, the copyedited files are converted to galleys – HTML, XML, PDF, etc. Again the author has the opportunity to proofread the galleys. Once everyone is satisfied, the submission is scheduled for publication in a future issue.

            Your Tasks are available from the top left menu of your Dashboard. Note the number “1” in the image below. This indicates that there is currently 1 task in your list.

            Tasks provide a quick look at items that need your attention. Bold entries are unread, and unbold entries have been read.

        <div class="Content">
          <p>
            When an author makes a new submission to your journal, the editor is automatically emailed a notification and the author will receive an email acknowledging their submission. You can also configure OJS so that a copy of the notification email is sent to the journal’s primary contact set in Journal Settings, or to another address.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enable copies of submission acknowledgment email to be sent to the primary contact or another address:
          </p>
      
          <ol style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              In the Journal Manager’s dashboard, go to Settings > Workflow > Submissions
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Scroll down to Notification of Author Submissions
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Check off the box next to “Send a copy to the primary contact, identified in the Journal Settings.” if you wish for a copy to be sent to the primary contact email, and/or
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Enter the email you would like to have a copy sent to in the text field.
            </li>
          </ol>
      
          <p>
            If you want to disable submission acknowledgement emails entirely, you can do so by disabling the Submission Ack email template from the list of prepared email templates. To learn more about disabling and enabling email templates, refer to Disable email templates in the

            <strong>My Assigned:</strong> This panel includes submissions added to sections where you are a section editor or to your own submissions if you are also an author with this journal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Search</strong> tool for each queue can sometimes be helpful in tracking down submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Filter</strong> tool allows you to limit your browsing to specific status (e.g., incomplete, overdue) stages (submission, review, copyediting, production), or sections (e.g., articles, reviews) for faster searching.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that you can use the blue arrows to the right of each submission to reveal more details, including how many reviews are outstanding, new discussions, and more. It also reveals buttons to take you to the submission record, view the activity log and notes, and to delete the submission.

            For this demonstration, we are looking for the Williamson and Serletis submission, entitled The Official Knowledge and Adult Education Agents. It can be found at the top of the <strong>My Assigned</strong> queue, as well as in the <strong>All Active</strong> queue.

          <p>
            Once you find the submission, you can use the blue arrow to reveal options to see if there are any open discussion (there are none), as well as to view the submission, view the activity logs and note, or to delete the submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Delete</strong> will move the submission to the Archives and <strong>Activity Log & Notes</strong> will bring up the submission’s history.

            <strong>Submission Files:</strong> This panel lists the files that have been submitted. In this view, there is just one file, but multiple files could have been submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pre-Review Discussions:</strong> This panel allows the editor to communicate with the author, or with others on the editorial team. For example, to ask the author for some additional information, or to ask a section editor to take responsibility for this submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action Buttons:</strong> These include Send to Review, Accept and Skip Review, and Decline Submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: If you don’t see these buttons, you likely have not yet assigned the submission to an editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Participants:</strong> This panel is where you will see the list of participants involved in the submission, including the editor, section editors, and author. Other names (copyeditors, layout editors, etc.) will appear here as they are added in subsequent steps.

            Use the Notes tab to also view or add any editorial notes.

          <p>
            Depending on how you have your sections configured, some new submissions may come in unassigned. If this is the case, the next step is to assign an editor or section editor. To do so, select the <strong>Assign</strong> link in the <strong>Participants</strong> panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will have the option to locate a user by role, choose an individual, and send them a message requesting their assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: If you aren’t sure of the names of the section editors, simply choose that role from the dropdown menu and then hit the Search button. All Section Editors will be displayed and available for selection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hit the <strong>OK</strong> button to make the assignment and send the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note the new Pre-Review Discussion that was automatically created as part of the assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can now see that the Section Editor is listed under Participants, and the Action buttons are available:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Send to Review:</strong> Moves the submission on to the next stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accept and Skip Review:</strong> Skips the Review Stage and moves the submission directly into Copyediting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Decline Submission:</strong> Rejects the submission before going through the review process. The submission would then be archived.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although in this example, the editor assigned a section editor, it would also be possible for the editor to assign herself to the submission.

            Now that the Section Editor has been assigned, she can login and view her dashboard. The submission can be found at the top of the My Assigned queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking on the article title opens the full submission record.

            Note: In the screenshot above, we see the Section Editor’s view. Notice the limited Action buttons (only Make Recommendation is available). If we were logged in as an Editor, we would see more Action buttons (Request Revisions, Resubmit for Review, Send to Copyediting, Decline Submission).

            From the Reviewers panel, you can select Add Reviewer to assign a new Reviewer.

            This opens a new window, where Reviewers are listed and can be selected one at a time.

          <p>
            In OJS releases 3.0 to 3.1.0, you cannot assign a user to review a submission if they are also an editor of the submission. If you do, the editor will no longer be able to access the submission after they submit their review, in order to maintain the principles of blind peer review. However, starting with OJS 3.1.1, you can assign a user to review a submission if they are also an editor of the submission.

          <p>
            This initiates a new window with a message for the Reviewer.

          <p>
            You can revise any of the prepared text.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are using a Blind Review method, ensure that the files you send to the Reviewer are stripped of any identifying information about the Author.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further down the form, you will see the additional details that are sent to the Reviewer including title, abstract, important dates, and a link to the files to be reviewed.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, Reviewers will be provided with an extended text box to type in their comments. However, the Journal Manager can create Review Forms in

        <div class="Content">
          <p>
            Online journals today publish their articles in a variety of file types. Most common are the PDF and HTML, but increasingly additional formats are being used, such as ePub, MP3, and XML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of author submissions come in as Microsoft Word documents (.doc or .docx), and typically move through the OJS workflow (review, revision, copyediting) in that format. Other formats sometimes include text (.txt), rich text format (.rtf), or Open Office (.odt). These aren’t suitable for final publication, so will need to eventually be converted into a more reader-friendly format.

        <div class="title-1">Working from Templates</div>
        
        <div class="Content">
          <p>
            Requiring all submissions to use a template that is pre-formatted with your journal’s publication styles (e.g., the font face, font size, boldness, placement, etc. of the header, body, footers, etc.) will make your document conversion much easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microsoft provides a brief overview for creating templates 
            <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/?utm_source=legacy&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=close_legacy" target="_blank" class="a">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you’ve created a template that matches your journal style, you should link it from your Author Guidelines, along with a brief explanation of the need to use the template. This means that all of your submissions will come in already formatted, saving your layout editor a significant amount of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s an example of an OJS journal that requires authors to download and use a template file: 
            <a href="https://journals.sfu.ca/pie/index.php/pie#authorGuidelines" target="_blank" class="a">Paideusis</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideally, your template should be created using styles rather than direct formatting. This not only ensures consistency throughout your documents, but will also aid in any conversions to other formats (e.g., HTML). Here’s an 
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/customize-or-create-new-styles-d38d6e47-f6fc-48eb-a607-1eb120dec563" target="_blank" class="a">

        <div class="title-1">Creating PDF files</div>
        
        <div class="Content">
          <p>
            A PDF is the easiest type of file to create from a Word document. Current versions of Microsoft Word (and other word processors) let you simply “Save As” a PDF. The majority of OJS journals publish their articles as PDFs.
          </p>
          <p>
            PDFs are also popular with many readers, as they most closely recreate the printed page. However, PDFs are often less flexible on mobile devices and do not always handle links or embedded media (such as sound or video files) particularly well. With the growing importance of mobile computing, ensuring your audience can easily read your articles on their phones or tablets is increasingly important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example (see PDF link at bottom of page): 
            <a href="https://www.journal.ilta.ie/index.php/telji/article/view/22/51" target="_blank" class="a">

        <div class="title-1">Creating HTML Files</div>
        
        <div class="Content">
          <p>
            HTML files have the advantage of flexibility. They handle linking and multimedia very well, and can fit on just about any screen - including phones and tablets. They do, however, look different than a printed page, so some readers continue to prefer a PDF. The ideal situation is to provide both PDF and HTML files to best meet the needs of your different users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We saw in the previous section that creating a PDF from a submitted Word file is easy. Unfortunately, creating HTML files is a little more time consuming. Word processors do not have effective tools for doing a “Save As” to HTML. Microsoft Word tries to do this, but the results are not useful for uploading to OJS. Instead, try following this workflow:
          </p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Convert the Word document. You can use this 
              <a href="https://word2cleanhtml.com/" target="_blank" class="a">free online tool</a> 
              to do an initial conversion.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Open the resulting HTML files in a text editor (e.g., NotePad in Windows) or HTML editor (e.g., Adobe Dreamweaver). From here, you will need to make any final clean up or formatting. Understanding the basics of HTML is required. Its not hard and there are many 
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank" class="a">free tutorials</a>, 
              but it does take some time.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Keep the HTML formatting basic. Just focus on paragraphs, line breaks, headings, and links. Don’t worry about fonts, colours, or other design elements - OJS will take care of all of that automatically as part of the overall journal design.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Upload to OJS as an HTML galley file
            </li>
          </ol>

            Similar to HTML files, ePub files are ideal for mobile devices, but require specialized coding to create. Conversion tools are available, such as

          <p>
            Like HTML files, some additional cleanup may be required after conversion and require some knowledge of the format.

          <p>
            Although not common, some journals also create audio files of their articles, to allow for users to listen to the content. This is particularly helpful to the visually impaired, but many people enjoy podcasts and audio books while traveling or doing other activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating audio files can either be done manually, by having someone read the article into a voice recorder, or automatically using Text to Speech software.
